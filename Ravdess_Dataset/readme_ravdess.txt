== File naming convention

Each RAVDESS file name is coded with unique 7-part identifier (e.g., 02-01-06-01-02-01-12.mp4).  Each 2-digit part of the identifier signifies a particular experimental condition 
for that file.  Ordering of the identifier codes is the same across all files.  File identifier codes are as follows:

Modality (1 = Audio-Video, 2 = Video-only, 3 = Audio-only)
Vocal channel (1 = speech, 2 = song)
Emotion 
   Speech (1 = neutral, 2 = calm, 3 = happy, 4 = sad, 5 = angry, 6 = fearful, 7 = disgust, 8 = surprised)
   Song   (1 = neutral, 2 = calm, 3 = happy, 4 = sad, 5 = angry, 6 = fearful)
Emotional intensity (1 = normal, 2 = strong). NOTE: There is no strong intensity for the 'neutral' emotion.
Statement (1 = Kids are talking by the door, 2 = Dogs are sitting by the door)
Repetition (1 = 1st rep, 2 = 2nd rep)
Actor (1 to 24. Odd = male, Even = female)

For example: 02-01-06-01-02-01-12.mp4
This file name refers to:  Video-only (02), Speech (01), Fearful (06), Normal intensity (01), Statement "dogs" (02), 1st Repetition (01), 12th Actor (12).  
The actor is female, as the actor ID number is even.
